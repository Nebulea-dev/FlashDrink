# Run the metro server

```
npx react-native start
```

# Run the application

```
npx react-native run-android
```

# Build the application

### For the first time 

Just follow this [really well made guide](https://medium.com/@tywosemail/building-an-apk-file-for-a-react-native-android-project-involves-several-steps-e97d1294aafc)

### If you're part of my ENSIMAG team

Put the very secret password in the `android/gradle.properties` file, then run `build.sh`.
You'll find the resulting APK at the root of the project, named `app-release.apk`
